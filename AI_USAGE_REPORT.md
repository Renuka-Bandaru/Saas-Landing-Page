# AI Usage Report

During the development of the ADmyBRAND AI Suite landing page, I utilized AI tools extensively to boost productivity, speed up UI/UX design, and maintain modern development standards. AI served as a collaborative assistant throughout the projectâ€”from initial brainstorming to final component polish.

## AI Tools Used

- **Primary tools**: ChatGPT (OpenAI), GitHub Copilot, Cursor
- **Key use cases**:
  - Generating React components with Tailwind CSS and Material-UI
  - Writing reusable UI sections like pricing cards, FAQs, and testimonial sliders
  - Implementing animations using Framer Motion

## Sample Prompts

1. "Create React pricing card with Tailwind CSS and with Framer motion."
2. "Help me implement a testimonials carousel using Swiper and React."
3. "Suggest a collapsible FAQ section with accessibility support using MUI and React."
4. "How to implement Glassmorphism"

## AI vs Manual Work Split

- **AI-generated**: *60%*
  - Layout skeletons for components (Hero section, Features, Pricing, FAQ)
  - Initial drafts of animations, icons, and transitions
  - Sample content and placeholder copywriting for SaaS messaging

- **Manual coding**: *40%*
  - State handling, props management, responsiveness adjustments
  - Connecting UI with real data and refining animation timing
  - Full integration with tools like Framer Motion, SwiperJS, and MUI components

- **Customization**:
  - I used AI-generated code as a foundation and customized it to align with the ADmyBRAND brand identity and 2025 design trends. I manually adjusted layout structure, responsiveness, and animation timing. 
  - Through this project, I learned how to use **Framer Motion** for smooth animations, experimented with **glassmorphism** for a modern UI feel, and worked in **Cursor IDE** for the first time, which helped speed up my development process.
